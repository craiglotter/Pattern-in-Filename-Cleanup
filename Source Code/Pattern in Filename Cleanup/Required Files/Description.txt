Pattern in Filename Cleanup

Pattern in Filename Cleanup is a quick and dirty application that is useful for stripping a pattern out of filenames. The search is recursive and a file is only tested once for the pattern. 

Patterns are described with a beginning and an ending value meaning that Patterns that vary slightly can be accomodated.
